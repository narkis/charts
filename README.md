MVVM, Navigation, rxJava2, retrofit2, okHTTP3


Architecture
This was done to demonstrate some basic retrofit / rxJava 2 functionality.
It is based on MVVM pattern where rxJava2 provides flowables to the Android ViewModel / LiveData and is then consumed by the UI.
The UI is using basic JetPack Navigation implementation that is easily extendable, contrained layouts for chart aspect ratio and compositing
